		<title>[Archive] Latest working Oh The Dungeons You'll Go plugin version</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Hi,<br>
		<br>
		Since the 1.19 update I've been trying to look for an update to this plugin, and I believe I found it like months ago and uploaded it to my server on 1.18.2 waiting for the moment to update to 1.19. some weeks ago I decided to finally update to 1.19.2 and went on the journey of updating every single plugin, but this plugin was nowhere to be found.
		<br>
		Seems like the dev of OTDYG felt so overwhelmed by the negative reviews and critics from many people (I remember the dev saying that even got d3ath threats!) and dropped the project entirely. So I started looking for archives on the internet where I can still get it, but the latest version that can be found now is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220531233155/https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/oh-the-dungeons-youll-go.76437/" target=_blank>Oh The Dungeons You'll Go 17_Spring_Equinox_2022_P1</a> (link to latest SpigotMC page saved on The Wayback Machine).
		<br>
		But to my surprise the latest version I got before for 1.18.2 still worked on 1.19.X and weirdly enough it can't be found anywhere. Sadly I don't remember how I got it (I just got it and forgot because I thought the plugin would still be updated), I believe I got it from the github page or other github like page from the author? the one I got it's called: <a href="https://bit.ly/OTDYG19" target=_blank>Oh The Dungeons You'll Go 19_Grain_in_Ear_P1</a> (link to a Mega link to download it, if Mega is not allowed, don't erase the post, I'll edit it and change the file hosting).
		<br>
		So yeah, there it is, the latest tested version working on 1.19.X, I'm not a dev (yet) so I can't give support. Anyways, Happy Holidays to y'all.
