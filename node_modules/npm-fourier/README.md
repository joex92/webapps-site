# npm-fourier
NPM module intended for brute-force calculations of the discrete Fourier transform and inverse discrete Fourier transform.

npm-fourier is an NPM module intended to compute one-dimensional Fourier transformations. These transformations take a collection of samples (real and complex) in a time-based domain, and maps it into a frequency-based domain. Conversely, with the inverse Fourier transform, this mapping in a frequency domain maps back to the initial collection of samples in a time-based domain.
