NPM Module for operations on the complex plane.

npm-complex is an ES6 library containing elementary operations on the complex plane. Private fields have yet to be introduced into the ECMAScript standard. However, this module makes use of closures in order to properly encapsulate data. (The use of closures may not be necessary in the future, with the potential release of [#private](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields#private-fields) fields. Until then, this remains the best approach.)
